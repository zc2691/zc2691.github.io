I'm currently a student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health studying Biostatistics focusing on Data Science in Public Health. 

I was born into a medical family. Deeply influenced by my father, a pronounced colorectal surgeon and oncologist in Shanghai, I have developed a keen interest in health and disease. I pursued a bachelor degree of Biological Sciences at USC and interned at Shanghai Biochip Corporation (SBC) and Merck Pharmaceutical previously. 


## Experiences

Here's my [resume](doc/resume.pdf). Please take a look!
